  <p class="aboutMyself">Hey, I am Yiyang Xu and I go by Meredith. I’m a forth year computer science major at UCSB. I’m passionate about learning new development tools and applying those tools to solve problems that I face in my daily life and in academia. During last summer, I started to be interested in web development and I always want to have a personal website to let other people get to know me better. Therefore, I took the initiative to learn node.js, Javascript, html, and CSS to build this website! This summer, I'm interning at Poshmark as a software engineer in the web team. I've been using technical skills to improve Poshmark's web app. Also, through my internship, I learned a lot about how to refactor my code and what it's like to develop a real world product. Furthermore, I've been doing a research project in Prof.Singh's lab at UCSB. Our research project uses the data from the reddit r/place experiment. It uses some machine learning models and computer vision techniques to help us classify pixels to images and study users' collective behavoirs through the experiment. More info can be found on the project page.

  <br/><br/>I am also a huge basketball fan. I enjoy playing basketball with friends and watching games as well. I also love hiking and traveling. Some photos I took during my past trips can be found here. I would love to visit as many countries and national parks as I can in the future. 

  <br/><br/><strong>Wondering if I am a good fit for your company? Here are my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17oIad4hWlJNeTNDhO-z6UrB-ne-_FFvV/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a> and <a href="/projects">projects</a>!</strong></p>
