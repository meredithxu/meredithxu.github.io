# My Personal Website
## The website can be veiwed at 
* https://meredithxu.github.io/
## Note
* This repo is for hosting the website on Github. The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/meredithxu/personal_website) which is for local server
## Purposes
* I build my personal website to host a portfolio. Also, I started to grow interests in web development this summer. By building a personal website, I learned and practiced web development concepts such as html, css, and web server. 
## Techniques I used are as follows
* html
* css
* bootstrap
* Javascript, node.js to start a web server locally
## Future Improvements
* Improving the background image of the home page so that it's more responsive when the window is resized
* Adding interactions and animations on the website 
* Changing the design of "About Me" page so that it looks nicer
* Cleaning the organization of files
